# Testing Stannum

`script/test-all` is the one entry point for the tests. CI and the local
gates (`benchmarks/local/gates.sh`) call it, so the three run the same
commands; this page is the index of every kind of test, what it needs and
where it runs.

```sh
script/test-all quick     # formatting, lint and unit tests; no PostgreSQL server
script/test-all full      # quick, then pg_tests, the cluster tests and conformance
script/test-all cluster   # one step; --list shows what a tier runs
```

| tier | steps |
|------|-------|
| `quick` | `headers` `fmt` `clippy` `rust-unit` `python-unit` |
| `full` | `quick`, then `pgrx` `install` `cluster` `conformance` |
| `gates` | `install` `cluster` `conformance` `oracle` (what `benchmarks/local/gates.sh` runs) |

Every command in the selected steps runs, and the run ends with a summary and
a nonzero exit if any failed; `--fail-fast` stops at the first failure and
`--logs DIR` writes each command's output to `DIR/<command>.log`. A failed
`install` always stops the run, since later steps would test another build.

## Prerequisites

- The Rust toolchain `rust-toolchain.toml` pins, with rustfmt and Clippy.
  Without a rustup proxy on `PATH`, `script/test-all` finds the pinned
  toolchain under `~/.rustup/toolchains`.
- For everything past `quick` except `fmt`, `rust-unit` and `python-unit`:
  PostgreSQL 17 or 18 with its server headers, `cargo-pgrx` 0.19.1 and
  `cargo pgrx init` pointed at that server. `script/test-all` uses the
  `pg_config` on `PATH` (or `PG_CONFIG`) and puts its `bindir` first on
  `PATH`, so `initdb`, `pg_ctl` and `psql` match it.
  **PostgreSQL 18 is the only sanctioned engine for this project's gates and
  benchmarks** (decision 2026-10-04): every gate, latency measurement, census
  row and pgembed checkpoint is produced on PG18. Do not mix major versions
  inside one measurement, do not compare a PG17 ratio against a PG18 baseline,
  and treat PG17 output as a historical artifact. The suite still *installs*
  under PG17 in CI for compatibility coverage; that is not the source of any
  number quoted in a plan ledger or gate.
- For the conformance suite, the count fuzzer and the exit test: a Python
  with `psycopg` 3 and PyYAML, named by `STANNUM_PYTHON` (default `python3`),
  for example `python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r
  benchmarks/requirements.txt`.
  **Set `STANNUM_PYTHON` explicitly on any machine whose default `python3` lacks
  the dependencies.** Without it, `script/test-all full` reports
  `conformance: FAILED (exit 1)` with
  `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg'` on code that is fine — the
  project's own venv (`.venv`, git-ignored) is not on any `python3`'s path, and
  Homebrew's `python3` has neither `psycopg` nor `PyYAML`. CI does not hit this
  because its Python carries the dependencies. Correct local invocation:
  `STANNUM_PYTHON=$PWD/.venv/bin/python script/test-all full`.
- Everything else in Python needs only the standard library and `psql`.

### The pgrx lock

`cargo pgrx test` and `cargo pgrx install` replace the extension in the
server's directories, and `cargo pgrx test` uses one server per machine (port
28800 + the major version). On a machine where several checkouts share that,
wrap every command that installs the extension or uses the installed one:

```sh
script/pgrx-lock.py -- cargo pgrx test pg18 -p stannum
```

`script/test-all` takes the lock itself, once, for its `pgrx`, `install`,
`cluster`, `conformance` and `oracle` steps. The lock is reentrant, so it can
run inside an outer hold. `$STANNUM_PGRX_LOCK` names the lock file (default
`/tmp/stannum-pgrx.lock`). `cargo pgrx test` leaves a debug build with test
hooks installed; `script/test-all install` restores the release build.

## Every kind of test

"CI" is `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: the `lint` job, the `build-and-test`
matrix (x86-64 and arm64, PostgreSQL 17 and 18) and the `reference-oracle`
job. "Step" is the `script/test-all` step that runs it.

To add a test, put it where its kind lives above; a new Python cluster test
also goes into the `cluster` step of `script/test-all`, which is what CI and
the gates run.

## The ranked scan under concurrency

The ranked (top-k) scan keeps state across the life of a scan: the scorer it
built, the rows it pruned to, and the write-buffer index it retained. Bugs in
that state (rows re-emitted after a deletion, a retained document scored with
another document's length after a buffer refresh) show up only under
concurrent writes, and the sustained-mutation benchmark's checks are not an
oracle. `postgres/tests/ranked_fuzz.py` is the oracle: a randomized
concurrency fuzzer for this class of bug.

### What the fuzzer does

It starts a throwaway cluster (install stannum first; standard library plus
`psql`, autovacuum off so every VACUUM is a scheduled step) and builds a small
corpus from a dozen templates, so exact score ties abound, in a table with a
random fillfactor. Several **writer sessions** then run random operations:
inserts, deletes, non-HOT updates (new body), HOT updates (a non-indexed
column), VACUUM, delete-VACUUM-insert cycles that reuse heap line pointers,
rolled-back inserts, multi-statement transactions, `keep`-table churn for
joins, and per-session tunables (`stannum.write_buffer_docs`,
`write_buffer_bytes`, `merge_tier_factor`, `max_segments`, `max_merge_docs`,
`build_segment_docs`) drawn from small values so folds, tiered merges and
deferred merges happen constantly. REINDEX and CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY run
only between reader transactions, so a lock wait cannot stall the scheduler.

**Reader sessions** run episodes. An episode opens a transaction (mostly
REPEATABLE READ, sometimes READ COMMITTED), pins its snapshot, lets writers
churn, and then, in one quiescent batch with no writer statement in flight:

1. runs the query through the unpruned path (`stannum.enable_custom_scan = off`,
   `ORDER BY score DESC, ctid`) for every matching row;
2. runs a regex sequential scan with the same predicate (`\mterm\M` per term,
   combined as the query combines them) and checks the match sets are equal;
3. reads the heap's HOT chains through `pageinspect`, since the scan orders a
   HOT-updated row by the root it posted while the executor projects the
   member's `ctid`;
4. runs the custom-scan query with `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`, or declares a cursor and
   fetches its first rows.

Statistics (document counts, lengths, frequencies) include buffered and
dead documents, so scores drift with every write; the quiescent batch is what
makes bit-for-bit comparison valid. A cursor then keeps fetching while writers
churn, sometimes with the fetch and a write overlapping in time, and its
whole output must equal the oracle's prefix: the scan retained its scorer, so
its scores must not move. A second cursor in the same transaction (same or
another query, its own oracle) checks that two scans do not share state.

Queries are single terms, `OR`, `AND` (two or three terms), boosts, phrases,
`AND NOT`, prefixes, `AT LEAST`, and `(a OR b) AND c`, scored by `full_score`
or `score`, with limits around 128 and 256 and above the 4,096-row pruning
cap, offsets, joins that read past k (`enable_hashjoin` and
`enable_mergejoin` off so the scan's order reaches the top; when a Sort still
sits above the scan, ties are compared tolerantly), and filters applied above
the scan.

Every result is checked for unique ids, finite scores, descending scores with
ties in heap order, membership in the regex match set, and
equality with the oracle's slice (ids, ctids and score text with
`extra_float_digits = 3`, which round-trips float4 exactly).

On a failure the fuzzer writes `failure.json` and `repro.sql` into its
artifact directory: the seed and arguments, the failing comparison, and every
statement issued, in order, labeled by session. Re-running with the same
`--seed`, `--seconds`, `--writers`, `--readers` and `--corpus` repeats the
scenario and random seed, but concurrent scheduling and the timed cutoff can
change the exact execution. Retain the failing trace for diagnosis;
`--stop-at N` stops after episode N.

```
python3 postgres/tests/ranked_fuzz.py --seed 7 --seconds 600
python3 postgres/tests/ranked_fuzz.py --smoke     # fixed seeds and REGRESSIONS
```

`--smoke` runs one fixed seed and the `REGRESSIONS` list in the script (each
a short configuration that once failed or pins a bug class) in under two
minutes; CI runs it in the `cluster` step.

### Bug classes it covers

- **HOT-updated rows.** The index holds the root of a HOT chain while the
  executor projects the visible member's `ctid`. `IndexScorer::score`
  resolves a location absent from every source to its chain root
  (`heap_get_root_tuples` under a share lock), so both ranked paths score
  such a row by its real score.
  Test: `hot_updated_rows_keep_their_score_on_both_ranked_paths`.
- **Several scans on one query.** Each scan publishes its scorer under its
  own identity with the score of every row it ranked, and records the row it
  emitted last with the statement number and an emission stamp. A score call
  in that statement for exactly that location takes the scan's score, newest
  emission first; any other location (an unpruned scan's row while a cursor
  is open on the same query, or a row a paused cursor emitted in an earlier
  statement) is scored by the statement's own scorer. The entry is dropped
  when the scan ends, including after an error.
  Test: `concurrent_cursors_on_one_query_keep_their_own_scores`.
- **Completed scans and buffer refreshes.** A scan that reads past its top k
  does not repeat rows it emitted, and a retained scorer keeps each
  document's own length after the buffer index is refreshed over reused heap
  space. Tests: `a_completed_ranked_scan_does_not_repeat_the_rows_it_emitted`
  and `buffered_scoring_keeps_document_lengths_when_heap_space_is_reused`,
  plus the fuzzer's cursor episodes, which exercise both interleavings
  continuously.

### Wide disjunction cursors

`--wide` uses 31, 32, 33 and 128 distinct alphabetic terms with positive
boosts. Documents mix dense 128-term bodies
with sparse 32-term bodies. Queries use `full_score` so common-term elision does
not remove the intended scoring terms. Episodes use cursors or two open cursors,
with limits around 128, offsets, filters and joins.

```sh
python3 postgres/tests/ranked_fuzz.py --wide --seed 104 --seconds 30 \
  --corpus 400 --writers 2 --readers 2
```

The quiescent oracle capture and the concurrent writer churn are those of
ordinary episodes. An extra EXPLAIN ANALYZE checks ordinal pruning while the
first cursor is open. This also exercises another statement's scorer without
allowing it to change the retained cursor's scores. Reports count exercised
widths; missing any of the four widths fails the run rather than silently passing
an empty or incomplete campaign. A fixed wide scenario is included in `--smoke`.
These are correctness stress tests, not performance measurements.

### Backends that exit mid-walk

A FATAL error (`pg_terminate_backend`, a fast shutdown, postmaster death)
exits a backend through `proc_exit` without unwinding the ranked walk it
interrupts. PostgreSQL releases the walk's pins and relation reference
itself; on Linux `exit` then runs the backend's thread-local destructors,
which drop the cached segment readers after `CurrentResourceOwner` is gone.
`postgres/tests/exit_during_walk.py` terminates 40 sessions, each busy with
ranked disjunctions, conjunctions and phrases, and then fast-stops the server
under four more. It fails on a changed postmaster start time, a lost control
connection, or any crash, restart, WARNING, ERROR or unexpected FATAL in the
server log. It needs a Linux server, so it runs in Docker (a few minutes,
most of it the image build):

```sh
STANNUM_PYTHON=.venv/bin/python benchmarks/local/exit-test.sh
# STANNUM_EXIT_IMAGE=... reuses an image built earlier
```

The table has 4.6 million documents because a walk checks for interrupts
only every 64 chunks of 65,536 rows. Below that, every termination lands
between walks. At this size most of them land with 7 to 17 pages held. The
walked readers stay referenced by the executor frame that the FATAL
abandons, so their destructors never run at exit. The ones that do run at exit hold nothing.
`a_reader_dropped_at_exit_leaves_its_pins_to_postgres` pins the contract
directly on any platform: a reader dropped during `proc_exit` with a span
open leaves its pin and relation to PostgreSQL.
