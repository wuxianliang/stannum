//! Boolean counts over segment-local document ordinals.
//!
//! A segment stores each term's documents as ordinals into its
//! TID-ordered document table (see [`segment::ordinals`]). A Boolean count
//! folds those streams a 65,536-document chunk at a time and counts set bits,
//! so its work follows the chunks the terms occupy rather than the number of
//! matches. Dead documents are cleared from each chunk; matches on heap pages
//! that are not all-visible leave the population count and are handed to the
//! caller for the per-tuple check. A location is live in one source only
//! (the index checker reports anything else), so per-segment counts add up.
